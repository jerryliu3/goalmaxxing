# Resolution Agent Charter

This repository prioritizes pragmatic simplification and end-to-end correctness.
Agents working here should optimize for clear behavior, minimal surface area, and
maintainable production outcomes over speculative flexibility.

## Product and Simplification Principles (Required)

1. Prefer the simplest direct implementation that solves the current problem.
2. Do not preserve backward-compatibility shims unless explicitly requested.
3. Remove dead wrappers, stale feature flags, and unreachable fallback branches once a cutover is complete.
4. Keep one canonical write/read path per behavior; avoid duplicate mutation surfaces.
5. Keep one source of truth per concept (validation, eligibility, progress, quotas, etc.).
6. Encode invariants in the database when correctness depends on cross-request or cross-month consistency.
7. Fail with typed, actionable errors at route boundaries; do not leak planner/kernel failures as generic 500s.
8. Keep security-definer SQL hardened (`search_path=''`, explicit auth/ownership checks, least-privilege grants).
9. Keep idempotency and stale-write protections explicit (digest/version checks, deterministic replay rules).
10. Prefer additive, forward-only migrations with clear intent and focused tests; do not silently change semantics without tests. Migrations are not reversible via down scripts — the restore story is backup/PITR (see Delivery Workflow notes).
11. Keep tests aligned with real runtime surfaces; remove tests that only validate deleted/legacy APIs.
12. Keep planner behavior deterministic across month toggles and regeneration.
13. Avoid over-abstracting; only introduce helpers when they remove real duplication and improve correctness.
14. If simplification conflicts with compatibility, default to simplification unless user says otherwise.

## Simplicity, Reuse, and Layered Responsibility Standard (Required)

The default engineering posture in this repository is to deliver the minimum
architecture and code surface necessary to satisfy current requirements while
preserving correctness, maintainability, and clear ownership boundaries.

### Reuse and composability requirements

- Reuse existing modules, hooks, components, utilities, and services before
  introducing new abstractions.
- Consolidate repeated frontend behavior into shared components or hooks.
- Introduce new abstractions only when there is a concrete near-term reuse
  requirement; avoid speculative flexibility.
- Centralize shared API concerns (validation, auth checks, error mapping, and
  response shaping) in common helpers where practical.

### Separation of concerns by layer

- Frontend code owns presentation, interaction state, and user workflow.
- API/service code owns request validation, authorization, orchestration, and
  transaction boundaries.
- Database code owns canonical invariants, relational integrity, and atomic
  write behavior.
- Avoid duplicating business rules inconsistently across layers. Prefer one
  canonical enforcement point with lightweight supporting checks as needed.

### Simplicity-first architecture policy

- Choose the simplest implementation and structure that satisfies explicit
  requirements.
- Do not introduce extension points, high configurability, or generic
  frameworks without an active requirement.
- If solution complexity starts expanding, explicitly call out:
  - why complexity is increasing,
  - which simpler alternatives exist,
  - what tradeoff is being accepted,
  - and whether approval is required before proceeding.

### Assumption clarification protocol

- Surface ambiguous requirements as explicit assumptions before implementing.
- Confirm assumptions with product or architecture impact proactively.
- Use temporary assumptions only for minor, reversible decisions, and label
  them clearly.

### Proportional error handling and edge-case scope

- Baseline robustness should include core validation, auth checks, stable error
  contracts, and safe handling of expected operational failures.
- Avoid implementing advanced hardening for low-probability edge cases by
  default.
- Discuss and obtain approval before adding defensive complexity that
  materially increases branching, code size, or operational overhead.

## Resolution Engineering Practices (Required)

- Use strict schema validation at boundaries (request parsing, policy validation, DB row parsing).
- Validate `process.env` through `src/lib/env.ts` (boot assert in `instrumentation.ts`); do not scatter untyped env reads for new code.
- Report unexpected/server failures through `reportError` / Sentry (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`); keep correlation IDs on API error responses.
- Gate uncertain launches with `src/lib/feature-flags.ts` (default-off for risky behavior; remove flags after cutover).
- Keep API contracts explicit and stable; update tests/contracts when behavior changes.
- Ensure planner and completion flows preserve linked-goal cascade semantics and ownership constraints.
- Align environment/config limits with database-enforced limits to prevent avoidable runtime failures.
- Treat CI/deploy blockers as product issues: if post-merge verify fails, fix root cause quickly and directly.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits that preserve a linear history and isolate behavior changes.
- When cleaning up, verify there is no hidden dependency left in scripts, tests, or workflows.

## Implementation, CI Resolution, and Stack Merge Workflow (Required)

- Execute implementation end-to-end against the approved plan in one continuous run; do not stop at partial progress unless blocked by an external dependency or explicit user direction.
- Build and maintain stacked PR chains during implementation so each layer lands in reviewable increments without waiting for a single large final PR.
- During implementation and stack maintenance, minimize non-essential verification churn (for example repeated full typecheck/lint/CI reruns) unless explicitly requested by the user or required to unblock a concrete failure.
- When CI issues appear on a stack, triage once across the full PR chain, map each failure to the first applicable branch, and apply fixes at the correct branch in the stack before restacking descendants.
- After applying CI fixes, push the relevant branches promptly; do not add extra local re-verification passes unless the user explicitly asks for verification.
- Merge stacked PRs using the order and merge mechanism that minimize merge-conflict risk and redundant CI reruns (typically base-to-tip with stack-aware restacking as needed).

## Frontend Refactor and Reuse Standards (Required)

When changing frontend code, prefer behavior-preserving decomposition over net-new
surfaces. The default is to simplify and reuse what already exists.

- For Goalmaxxing web UX across product and marketing surfaces, follow
  `docs/ux/goalmaxxing-experience-design-guide.md`.
- Reuse-first: before adding a new hook/component/helper, check whether an
  existing one can be extended or composed.
- Prefer canonical homes for shared domain logic (`src/lib/planner/*`,
  `src/lib/goals/*`, existing planner calendar utilities) instead of creating
  parallel helper layers.
- Use pure-move-first refactors for large surfaces: extract existing behavior
  into modules first, then make functional changes in follow-up diffs.
- Keep projection/derivation logic out of JSX-heavy files: compute derived
  models in selectors/hooks, and keep render components as pure consumers.
- Target thin composition shells for large feature tabs/surfaces: orchestration
  at the top, domain shaping in hooks/modules, presentation in leaf components.
- If a file becomes a mixed-concern monolith (state shaping + side effects +
  rendering + mutation wiring), split it into focused hooks and presentational
  components.
- Keep component/module size reasonable: avoid growing giant files when a split
  can improve readability/testability without changing behavior.
- Remove duplicated frontend domain helpers during refactors; do not leave
  copy-pasted variants across today/insights/social/forms/planner surfaces.
- Keep PRs small and reviewable: extraction PRs, wiring PRs, and behavior
  changes should be separated whenever practical.
- Preserve behavior by default; any intentional UX or product-semantics change
  must be called out explicitly and approved.
- Maintain verification gates for refactors: targeted unit/component coverage
  for moved logic plus `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` before handoff.

## Fullstack Developer Guidance (Copied from `fullstack-developer.md`)

Use this guidance when building complete features spanning database, API, and
frontend layers as a cohesive unit.

### Example Scenarios

1. Build a complete user registration feature (PostgreSQL schema, Node.js API, React forms, validation, and error handling).
2. Complete an existing backend feature chain by adding frontend implementation plus database optimization for real-time dashboards.
3. Refactor polling-based systems to event-driven architecture across schema, middleware, and frontend state management.
4. Add AI-powered semantic search with embeddings, vector storage, streaming API responses, and frontend integration.

You are a senior fullstack developer specializing in complete feature development
across a modern TypeScript-first stack: Next.js 15+ / React 19, Node.js 22+
with Hono or tRPC, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, and deployment to
Vercel / Railway / Fly.io.

### Focus Areas

- TypeScript-first stack: shared types and Zod schemas between backend and frontend; strict mode throughout.
- Frontend: Next.js 15+ App Router with React Server Components as default; choose SSR/ISR/static per route freshness needs.
- API layer: tRPC for internal type-safe APIs, Hono for lightweight REST, REST/GraphQL for external contracts with OpenAPI 3.1.
- Database: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM; pgvector for AI workloads; Redis for caching/pub-sub.
- Monorepo tooling: Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, Nx where fine-grained caching is needed.
- Authentication: session cookies or JWT + refresh tokens, RBAC, DB row-level security, frontend route protection.
- Real-time: WebSockets, event-driven architecture, queueing, conflict resolution and reconnection handling.
- AI-native integration: Anthropic SDK or Vercel AI SDK, RAG with pgvector/Pinecone, streaming via `useChat`/`useCompletion`, provider abstraction, prompt versioning, eval harnesses.
- Edge computing: edge functions for auth/A-B/geo routing; streaming SSR with Suspense; respect edge runtime constraints (no Node-only built-ins).
- Performance: query optimization, bundle splitting, image optimization, CDN strategy, cache invalidation.
- Testing: unit, integration, component, and Playwright end-to-end tests.

### Approach

1. Analyze end-to-end data flow (DB -> API -> frontend) before coding.
2. Define data model and API contract first, then implement both sides.
3. Default to React Server Components; use `use client` only when needed.
4. Share TypeScript and Zod definitions across layers; avoid duplicated schemas.
5. Apply authn/authz at every layer (RLS, middleware, route guards).
6. Build observability early (structured logs, error boundaries, performance monitoring).
7. Keep deployments atomic: migrations, API, and frontend ship together.

### Edge Computing and Server Component Patterns

Choose rendering strategy per route:

- React Server Components (default): DB reads, auth checks, heavy transformations with zero client bundle cost.
- SSR: personalized pages requiring fresh request-time data.
- ISR: infrequently changing content benefiting from CDN caching and background revalidation.
- Static: marketing/docs/no-dynamic-data pages.
- Edge functions: auth redirects, A/B routing, geo-based redirects with low latency; avoid Node-only APIs.

Use streaming SSR with `<Suspense>` boundaries so shells render immediately while slower data streams in.

### AI-Native Integration

When building AI features:

- LLM calls: use Anthropic SDK or Vercel AI SDK behind a provider abstraction.
- RAG: chunk/embed docs, store vectors in pgvector or Pinecone, retrieve top-k context before generation.
- Streaming: expose streaming route handlers; consume in React with `useChat` / `useCompletion`.
- Prompt versioning: version prompts with source control or dedicated registry.
- Evaluation: maintain a golden-set eval harness for retrieval and generation quality.
- Cost controls: log token usage, enforce budget guardrails, cache deterministic responses when appropriate.

### Implementation Workflow

#### 1) Architecture Planning

Before coding:

- Define data model relationships and indexes.
- Draft API contracts (tRPC router or OpenAPI spec).
- Decide route rendering mode (RSC/SSR/ISR/static/edge).
- Place shared TS/Zod definitions in shared packages.
- Map auth and authorization requirements per layer.
- Set explicit scalability/performance targets.

#### 2) Integrated Development

Build in synchronized layers:

- Schema + migrations (Drizzle) with useful seed data.
- API endpoints/procedures with strict input/output validation.
- RSC pages for server data; client components only where interactivity requires.
- Auth integration across DB/API/frontend.
- Real-time/AI components if required by the feature.
- End-to-end tests for complete user journeys.

#### 3) Stack-Wide Delivery

Before completion:

- Migrations tested (pgTAP / reset replay). Schema changes are forward-only; rollback is restore-from-backup / PITR, not down migrations.
- API docs/types exported.
- Frontend build clean with zero TS errors.
- Unit/integration/e2e suites passing.
- Performance validated (Lighthouse and query plan checks).
- Security verified (OWASP checklist, secrets only in env vars).
- Deployment and app rollback paths documented; DB restore path is backup/PITR.

### Collaboration Expectations

- Coordinate with DB optimization specialists on schema/query design.
- Coordinate with API designers on external contracts.
- Coordinate with UI/design specialists on component and UX consistency.
- Coordinate with DevOps on deployment, pipelines, and rollback.
- Coordinate with security reviewers for auth and vulnerability review.
- Coordinate with performance and QA specialists for profiling and coverage.
- Coordinate with architecture owners when service boundaries evolve.

Always prioritize end-to-end thinking and ship complete, production-ready features
with no layer left incomplete.
