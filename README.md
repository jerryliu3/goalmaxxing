# Cadence

Cadence is a mobile-first goal-tracking web app built with Next.js + Supabase.
It supports:

- Daily, weekly, and monthly recurring goals
- Fixed goals and recurring goals with optional target counts
- A strict once-per-day completion invariant
- Linked-goal completion cascades
- Insights heatmaps and completion percentages
- Read-only sharing and collaborative group goals
- Bulk goal creation from CSV/XLSX and natural-language parsing
- Scheduled Web Push reminders on desktop and iOS Home Screen apps

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix-based components)
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, RLS, RPC)
- `@supabase/ssr` for auth/session handling
- `date-fns` for all date math

## Local Development (End-to-End)

### 1) Start Supabase locally

```bash
pnpm supabase:start
```

This starts local Postgres/Auth/Storage using Docker.

### 2) Get local credentials

```bash
pnpm supabase:status
```

Copy values into `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Set:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (usually `http://127.0.0.1:54321`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (use the **Publishable** key shown by `supabase status`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (optional; used for auth redirect links such as signup confirmation and password reset)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional, only needed for AI natural-language bulk parsing)

Push notifications also require:

- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (server-only; `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is also supported)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `VAPID_SUBJECT` (a `mailto:` address or `https:` URL)
- `CRON_SECRET` (a long random server-only value)

Generate a VAPID key pair with:

```bash
pnpm exec web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

### 3) Apply migrations and seed data

```bash
pnpm supabase:reset
```

This applies:

- `supabase/migrations/*.sql`
- `supabase/seed.sql`

### 4) Run the app

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the public landing page,
or go directly to [http://localhost:3000/calendar](http://localhost:3000/calendar)
for the authenticated app.

## Demo Accounts (Seeded)

- `alice@example.com` / `password123` (platform **moderator** — can open `/ux` labs)
- `bob@example.com` / `password123`
- `carla@example.com` / `password123`

Seed data includes:

- Goals across all frequency types
- Completion history spanning ~8 weeks
- A linked-goal chain (`A -> B -> C`)
- A read-only shared goal
- A group goal with multiple participants

## Useful Commands

- `pnpm dev` - start Next.js dev server
- `pnpm build` - production build
- `pnpm lint` - lint checks
- `pnpm test` - run unit tests
- `pnpm test:tz` - run timezone checks in Los Angeles and Auckland processes
- `pnpm test:sql` - run pgTAP SQL tests against local Postgres
- `pnpm test:concurrency` - run the two-session PostgreSQL lock harness
- `pnpm test:e2e` - run authenticated Chromium, WebKit, mobile, API, and accessibility smoke tests
- `pnpm types:supabase` - regenerate local public/private database types
- `pnpm supabase:start` - start local Supabase stack
- `pnpm supabase:stop` - stop local Supabase stack
- `pnpm supabase:status` - print local URLs and keys
- `pnpm supabase:reset` - reset DB, apply migrations, run seed

Database and browser tests require the local Supabase stack and seeded demo accounts. Playwright starts
the app on `http://localhost:3100` so it does not reuse another development server on port 3000.

Calendar / planner is permanently enabled in the product shell. Uncertain
launches (for example cross-month moves) use env flags in
`src/lib/feature-flags.ts` instead of a calendar kill switch.

Planner persistence is additive and blocks direct client writes. Immutable plan
snapshots are stored in public planning tables, while revisions, owner-lock
helpers, and AI quota counters remain in the unexposed `private` schema.

## Pointing to Hosted Supabase

1. Create a hosted Supabase project.
2. Set `.env.local` with hosted URL and your publishable/anon client key.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your deployed app URL (for example, your Vercel domain).
4. In Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> URL Configuration:
   - Set **Site URL** to your deployed app URL.
   - Add `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/login` to **Redirect URLs**.
   - Add `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/reset-password` to **Redirect URLs**.
5. Optional: in Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers -> Email, disable **Confirm email**
   if you want immediate app access after signup. (Tradeoff: mailbox ownership is not enforced at signup.)
6. Apply migrations through your normal deployment workflow (`supabase db push` / CI).
7. Optionally adapt seed loading if you want demo data hosted.

## Scheduled Push Notifications

Supabase Cron invokes `/api/push/dispatch` at the top of every hour. This avoids Vercel Hobby's
once-per-day Cron limit while keeping the dispatch function on Vercel.

Before applying the scheduler migration to hosted Supabase, create these encrypted secrets in
**Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Vault**:

- `push_dispatch_url`: the full deployed endpoint, such as
  `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/push/dispatch`
- `push_cron_secret`: the exact same value configured as `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel

The `schedule_push_dispatch_with_supabase_cron` migration enables `pg_cron` and `pg_net`, then
creates the hourly `dispatch-push-notifications-hourly` job. If the Vault secrets are not present,
the job safely performs no HTTP request. Job runs and HTTP responses can be inspected in
**Supabase Dashboard → Integrations → Cron** and the `net._http_response` table.

The Goal score percentile ("Top N%") ranks against a daily snapshot refreshed by the
`refresh-grow-score-standings-daily` job (08:15 UTC). It reuses `push_cron_secret` and needs one
more Vault secret:

- `grow_score_standings_url`: the full deployed endpoint, such as
  `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/social/grow-score/standings`

Each user gets an enabled 9:00 PM reminder in their device's IANA timezone when notification
settings are initialized. It can be disabled, and users can create additional daily reminders.
Expired browser subscriptions are removed automatically.

On iOS or iPadOS 16.4 and newer:

1. Add Cadence to the Home Screen from the browser Share menu.
2. Open Cadence from its Home Screen icon.
3. Go to **Settings** and tap **Enable** under Push notifications.

iOS does not allow a normal browser tab to request Web Push permission. Permission must be
requested from the installed Home Screen app in response to the Enable button.
